Hi, I am a Master’s candidate in [Economics at Columbia University’s GSAS](https://econ.columbia.edu/). I earned my Bachelor’s degree in [Finance](http://www.cec.zju.edu.cn/), with a minor in [Artificial Intelligence](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/), from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), where I had the privilege of being advised by [Prof. Jieran Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/jieranwu). My research during that time explored areas like **rational inattention** and **network analysis**, sparking a deep enthusiasm for academic inquiry. 

I am eager to continue this journey toward a PhD in the future. As the saying goes, “The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.”
